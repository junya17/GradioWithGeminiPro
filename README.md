# Chatbot Story Generator

This project implements a chatbot interface using Gradio that generates stories based on user input. It integrates an external API for generating the content, making it a unique and interactive way to create stories.

## Installation

Before you can use this chatbot, you need to ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You will need `gradio` and `requests` libraries. You can install them using pip:

## Setting Up Your Environment
